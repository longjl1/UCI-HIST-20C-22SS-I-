# 💡 The Progressive Era

### The History of Historians and Progressivism

> Progressivism was not a popular revolution; rather it was a careful reordering. The white **middle class** guided its reform.&#x20;
>
> by Richard Hofstadter, 1954

### Building on Hofstadter

_**Robert Wiebe**_, another historian, built on Hofstadter’s work

> **Progressives** were **white middle-class** men who deplored the chaos that resulted from industrialization and urbanization and who imposed order on what seemed to them a strange new world.
>
> 进步主义 是中产阶级白人男性, 他们对工业化和城市化带来的混乱感到遗憾，并对在他们看来陌生的新世界强加秩序 :thinking: :white\_heart:
>
> #### Problems with Hofstadter and Wiebe
>
> But -> It has problom with the theory -> if all of the progressives were **middle class organizers**, progressivism could be seen simply as a way to impose social control over the growing working classes, immigrants, and unsatisfied farmers
>
> 如果所有的进步人士都是中产阶级的组织者，那么进步主义就可以被看作是对不断增长的工人阶级、移民和不满意的农民实施社会控制的一种方式 :man\_factory\_worker:

### 1970s - 1980s

Revisionist historians (修正主义的历史学家们) began to find more diversity among the progressives than the organizational historians had.

> They found **women reformers**, **working-class political organizations**, **African Americans** operating settlement houses, and **urban immigrant associations** working for better government :black\_heart:

### Historians in the 1990s

Historians: urban working-class were the real progressives

> This meant that the working class had a great deal of influence in determining the Progressive agenda.

### <mark style="background-color:purple;">Political Legacies of Progressivism</mark>

Four constitutional amendments (16-19) and two transformative acts of legislation ([Anti-Immigration Laws](law-and-immigration-and-the-progressive-era/anti-immigration-laws.md) & [minimum wage laws](union-league-and-strikes.md#in-the-aftermath-of-triangle-there-was-a-wave-of-workers-compensation-laws))

**Sixteenth Amendment:** The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration.

国会有权对任何来源的收入征收税款，无需在各州之间进行分配，也无需考虑任何人口普查或统计。

Support for the income tax was strongest <mark style="color:blue;">in the western and southern states and opposition was strongest in the northeastern states.</mark> Supporters of the income tax believed that it would be a much better method of gathering revenue than tariffs, which were the primary source of revenue at the time. The South and the West tended to support income taxes because their residents were generally less prosperous, more agricultural, and more sensitive to fluctuations in commodity prices. The income tax was to be a cornerstone of a broad-based prosperity. This amendment instituted the progressive income tax. The progressive income tax was the quintessential farmer-labor demand from the 1870s on.

对所得税的支持在西部和南部各州最为强烈，而反对意见在东北部各州最为强烈。所得税的支持者认为，与当时的主要收入来源--关税相比，这将是一种更好的征收方法。南部和西部倾向于支持所得税，因为他们的居民通常不太繁荣，更多的是农业，对商品价格的波动更敏感。所得税将成为基础广泛的繁荣的一个基石。这项修正案建立了累进所得税。从19世纪70年代开始，累进所得税是农民和工人的典型需求。
