# 🚗 LAW & Immigration and the Progressive Era

There was mass immigration to the United States at the turn of the <mark style="color:blue;">20th</mark> century.

In 1892 the first federal receiving station was established at Ellis Island in New York City harbor. Immigrants passed much more quickly through Ellis Island than Angel Island off the coast of San Francisco, which was established as an Ellis Island equivalent on the West Coast in 1910.

<mark style="color:blue;">Asian</mark> women were kept for long periods at Angel Island because authorities deemed them sexually immoral and could only be released once they could prove their respectability which sometimes included proving that they had a man to marry.

Young European women were regarded as sexually vulnerable rather than sexually immoral.

Many immigrants did not remain in New York or San Francisco but moved to find jobs in Chicago, Milwaukee, and various mining towns in the West.

In the late 19th century most native-born Americans regarded the incoming masses as disturbingly different <mark style="color:blue;">aliens</mark> who could never assimilate. 在19世纪末，大多数土生土长的美国人将外来的群众视为令人不安的异类，他们永远不可能被同化。
