# 👩 Maternalism

Maternalist presumptions underlay policies designed on behalf of working women and mothers alike.

One reform goal was establishing legal maximum workday hours for women but in 1905, in the case of Lochner v New York, the Supreme Court ruled that <mark style="color:blue;">any attempt to regulate wage labor relations for men or women was unconstitutional infringement on individual freedom of contract</mark>. 一个改革目标是为妇女建立法定的最长工作时间，但在1905年，在Lochner诉纽约一案中，最高法院裁定，任何试图规范男性或女性工资劳动关系的行为都是对个人合同自由的违宪侵犯。

But in 1908 when the case of Muller v Oregon, an Oregon maximum hours law only for women workers was brought to the Supreme Court the case hinged instead on women’s potential future maternal capacity, presented in the Brandeis Brief.

The brief argued that “<mark style="color:blue;">women are fundamentally weaker than men</mark>,” in defending against the assault of wage labor and thus <mark style="color:blue;">needed to be safeguarded by the state</mark>; and that <mark style="color:blue;">**protection**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">of women’s maternal capacity was necessary for the</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">**general welfare of the nation**</mark>. 该简报认为，在抵御雇佣劳动的攻击方面，"妇女从根本上说比男人弱"，因此需要得到国家的保护；保护妇女的生育能力对国家的总体福利是必要的。

The Supreme Court <mark style="color:blue;">**accepted**</mark> the argument that while men’s hours couldn’t be regulated by law, women’s could because of maternal capacity.

Within a decade all but 9 states had ushered in protective labor legislation, passing maximum work hours for working women.
