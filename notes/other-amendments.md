### <mark style="color:blue;">Nineteenth Amendment(</mark><mark style="color:blue;">**Passed in 1920**</mark><mark style="color:blue;">)</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">**!\~!! All women who are citizens of the U.S. get the right to vote**</mark>&#x20;

* This was the most profound of all the democratic transformations of the Progressive Era.
* After the <mark style="color:blue;">**Civil War**</mark> women tried voting after the passage of the 14th and 15th Amendments to find themselves imprisoned and fined- <mark style="color:blue;">courts declared in the 1870s that women were citizens but without all of the privileges of citizenship.</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">****</mark> As a result, <mark style="color:orange;">suffragists looked to states to pass voting rights at the state level. The Progressive Era opened a new opportunity for women’s activism at the federal level for the vote.</mark> 内战结束后，妇女在第14和第15修正案通过后尝试投票，发现自己被监禁和罚款--法院在19世纪70年代宣布，妇女是公民，**但没有公民的所有特权**。因此，女权主义者希望各州能在州一级通过投票权。进步时代为妇女在联邦一级争取投票权的活动提供了新的机会。
