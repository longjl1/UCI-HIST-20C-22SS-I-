# 👩 Women Wage Earners in the Progressive Era

**In 1900, **<mark style="color:blue;">**18.3%**</mark>** of the labor force was female, but this figure was rising and would reach **<mark style="color:blue;">**21.4%**</mark>** by 1920.  因为** [**Progressive Era**](../other-amendments.md#nineteenth-amendment-passed-in-1920)****

More than half of the female working population was <mark style="color:blue;">foreign-born</mark> and/or <mark style="color:blue;">nonwhite</mark>.&#x20;

The wage rate for women workers was very low: <mark style="color:blue;">in 1900, the average woman worker made about half of what the average male worker earned.</mark> This <mark style="color:blue;">disparity</mark> reflected the fact that men and women largely worked in different occupations and industries. <mark style="color:blue;">Domestic service (家政服务)</mark> was still the largest category of female employment, but <mark style="color:blue;">manufacturing</mark> was steadily gaining.&#x20;

The average working woman was young and <mark style="color:blue;">unmarried</mark>. Only among <mark style="color:blue;">African American</mark> populations did mothers and wives constitute a significant portion of women workers.
