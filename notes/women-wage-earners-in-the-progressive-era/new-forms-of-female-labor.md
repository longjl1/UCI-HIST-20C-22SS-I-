# ðŸ‘·â™€ New Forms of Female Labor

New areas of womenâ€™s paid work emerged in the early 20th century.

<mark style="color:blue;">Clerical work</mark>, once entirely <mark style="color:blue;">male</mark> and a form of apprenticeship in the <mark style="color:blue;">business</mark> world, was <mark style="color:blue;">rapidly growing and desirable for women</mark>

Yet just as clerical work was being feminized, it was becoming mechanized and routinized, and thus losing its capacity to offer upward mobility.

In the offices of mail order houses, banks, insurance companies, and large corporations, the labor of secretaries and typists was beginning to look like factory labor, at times even including the same piece-rate payment system where you were paid deflated wages based on output.

### Professional Jobs (Mostly white wealthy women)

By the end of the 19th century women were between 5-6% of the <mark style="color:blue;">medical profession</mark>.

The <mark style="color:blue;"></mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">**legal field**</mark> was much more hostile than medicine to women- in 1900 fewer than 600 women were practicing law in the U.S.[ <mark style="color:blue;">But by 1920 this number tripled</mark>.](../other-amendments.md#nineteenth-amendment-passed-in-1920)

<mark style="color:blue;">Social work</mark> became a main vehicle for employment for educated white women.

By 1920 there were 30,000 trained social workers, most of them women.

<mark style="color:blue;">During and after the Civil War nursing shifted from a form of domestic service to a profession.</mark> Between 1900-1910 there was a tenfold increase in the number of professionally trained nursing women. Many professional nursing women worked as public health missionaries going into immigrant homes to investigate epidemic disease.

Because of <mark style="color:blue;">**segregation**</mark> in the North and South African American women were excluded from white-run training programs and occupational associations that structured professions. <mark style="color:blue;">But black women established their own nursing schools and professional association, the National</mark> Association of Colored Graduate Nurses, in 1908. Since segregation demanded separate institutions for black and white people, black women worked as librarians, physicians, and teachers.
