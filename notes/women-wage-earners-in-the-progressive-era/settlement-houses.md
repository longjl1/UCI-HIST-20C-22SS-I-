# 🔵 Settlement Houses

Settlement houses were pioneered in England in the 1880s by male college graduates who chose to live among and serve the urban poor. By 1890, settlement houses were beginning to appear in the United States, with the important difference being that most of their participants were <mark style="color:blue;">middle-and-upper class women</mark>. 安置所是19世纪80年代在英国由男性大学毕业生开创的，他们选择生活在城市贫民中并为他们服务。到1890年，安置所开始在美国出现，重要的区别是其参与者大多是中上阶层的妇女。

The most influential settlement house was Hull House, established in Chicago in 1889 by <mark style="color:blue;"></mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark>_<mark style="color:blue;">**Jane Addams.**</mark>_

Hull House also encouraged the spread of American values and culture, but Hull House valued immigrants for their home cultures as well.&#x20;

Jane Addams built her life as a reformer around the traditional womanly virtues of care, nurturance, and concern for family life. She never married, but <mark style="color:blue;">dedicated her life to social work.</mark>&#x20;

Women-based settlement houses soon appeared in other immigrant-dense cities, like the Henry Street Settlement in New York City run by Lillian Wald, and Telegraph Hill Neighborhood Association in San Francisco.
