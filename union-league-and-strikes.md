# 👭 UNION LEAGUE & Strikes

## The Women’s Trade Union League (WTUL)

Despite the expansion of working opportunities for women in the <mark style="color:blue;">clerical</mark> and professional employment, <mark style="color:blue;">industrial workers, especially young immigrants</mark>, were considered the most <mark style="color:blue;">representative</mark> working women of the Progressive Era. 尽管妇女在文职和专业就业方面的工作机会有所扩大，但产业工人，特别是年轻移民，被认为是进步时代最具代表性的职业妇女。

Industrial working women made up 25% of the female work force <mark style="color:blue;">but they received little assistance</mark> from the established trade union movement.

{% hint style="info" %}
The male-dominated American Federal of Labor (AFL), regarded women wage earners not as potential union recruits, but as either as underpaid <mark style="color:orange;">threats</mark> to their members’ jobs, or as pitiful <mark style="color:orange;">victims (可怜的受害者)</mark> of capitalist greed.
{% endhint %}

The Women’s Trade Union League formed in 1903 to reconcile women workers and the organized labor movement. Mebership was open to all committed to the labor organization of women, regardless of class or of union membership.

The WTUL was a coalition of women trade union activists and leisure-class women (known as “allies”), primarily drawn from the [settlement ](notes/women-wage-earners-in-the-progressive-era/settlement-houses.md)house movement. While the WTUL worked hard on behalf of white and immigrant working-class women, its record was weak when it came to black women workers. Black workers, even more than white working women, faced hostility from the white men who led the American labor movement, and were hired at lower wages than white women. WTUL是一个由女性工会活动家和休闲阶层妇女（被称为 "盟友"）组成的联盟，主要来自安置房运动。虽然WTUL为白人和移民工人阶级妇女努力工作，但当涉及到黑人女工时，它的记录很薄弱。黑人工人，甚至比白人女工更面临来自领导美国劳工运动的白人男子的敌意，他们被雇用的工资比白人妇女低。

After WWI the WTUL shifted its emphasis from trade union organization to the passage of state maximum workday hours and minimum wage laws for women.\


### Strikes and Women Workers

A wave of early twentieth-century working women’s strikes took place during the [<mark style="color:blue;">Progressive Era</mark>](notes/other-amendments.md#nineteenth-amendment-passed-in-1920).

The most famous of these took place over the winter of 1909-1910 in New York City in the shirtwaist (blouse) industry.

The strike began when Local 25 of the <mark style="color:blue;">**International Ladies Garment Workers Union**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">国际女装工会</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">****</mark> (ILGWU), a small male-dominated organization, struck on several manufactures over low wages and bad working conditions.

As a result they turned to the WTUL for help but when leisure-class women joined the picket lines they were subjected to the same disrespectful treatment as the striking immigrant women workers, which made the newspapers take notice. 因此，她们转向WTUL寻求帮助，但当有闲阶级的妇女加入纠察线时，她们受到了与罢工的移民女工一样的不尊重待遇，这让报纸注意到了。

Large clothing manufacturers held out against workers by <mark style="color:blue;">sending their unfinished garments</mark> to shops that he ILGWU was not targeting.&#x20;

Facing defeat, the union called a general <mark style="color:blue;">strike of the entire New York City shirtwaist industry</mark>, which was a bold move by young immigrant teenage women. 面对失败，工会召集了整个纽约市衬衫腰带行业的总罢工，这是年轻的移民少女们的一个大胆行动。

On November 22, 1909, more than <mark style="color:blue;">15,000</mark> shirtwaist workers showed up at a mass meeting to discuss how to proceed against the <mark style="color:blue;">manufacturers</mark>. The next day between 20-30 thousand workers, 2/3 of them Eastern European Jews were on strike. This was known as the <mark style="color:blue;">**Uprising of 20,000.**</mark> 1909年11月22日，超过1.5万名衬衫厂工人出席了一个群众会议，讨论如何对制造商采取行动。第二天，2-3万名工人，其中2/3是东欧犹太人举行了罢工。这被称为 "两万人的起义"。

### The Aftermath of the Strike: Triangle

After almost <mark style="color:blue;">3 months</mark>, the shirtwaist strike was settled. Many, but not all of the manufacturers agreed to a <mark style="color:blue;">52 hour work week</mark>, no more fines for worker’s mistakes, more worker involvement in setting wages, and even <mark style="color:blue;">paid holidays</mark>. 经过近3个月的时间，衬衫厂罢工得到了解决。许多，但不是所有的制造商同意每周工作52小时，不再对工人的错误进行罚款，更多的工人参与制定工资，甚至带薪假期。

But they would <mark style="color:blue;">not allow</mark> the <mark style="color:blue;">ILGWU</mark> to represent the workers in future labor negotiations.

But a year after the shirtwaist strike a <mark style="color:blue;">tragic event</mark> took place demonstrating why women’s union representation was so important, and what could happen when not all factories agreed to the terms of the settlement. 但是，在衬衫罢工一年后，发生了一个悲剧性事件，表明为什么妇女的工会代表如此重要，以及当不是所有的工厂都同意和解条款时可能发生什么。

The Triangle Shirtwaist Company had begun locking the doors of its Manhattan factory after workers arrived to keep union organizers out, and workers in. On March 25, 1911, a fire broke out on the 10th floor. Workers found that they were locked inside the building. Desperately they ran to the roof. Some were able to escape, others jumped off the building to their deaths on the concrete below, and others burned alive inside the building. The fire killed 146 workers, more than ¼ of the Triangle’s workers. 火灾惨案

### In the aftermath of Triangle there was a wave of worker’s compensation laws

11 states passed <mark style="color:blue;"></mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">**minimum wage laws**</mark> by 1917
