# Woman Suffrage before 1900

Women believed they had the right to vote with the passage of the Reconstruction Amendments (14th granted citizenship).&#x20;

But with the decision in Minor v Happersett the Supreme Court ruled unanimously in 1875 that <mark style="color:blue;">suffrage for women was not protected under the 14th Amendment of the Constitution.</mark>&#x20;

As a result, suffragists turned away from <mark style="color:blue;">agitating for a federal suffrage amendment</mark> in attempt to <mark style="color:blue;">win voting rights</mark> at the state level.&#x20;

With the <mark style="color:blue;">expansion</mark> to the <mark style="color:blue;">West and the Populist movement</mark> of the <mark style="color:blue;">1890s</mark> women won major victories in the West.&#x20;

In 1869 the territory of Wyoming offered suffrage to women hoping to entice women out west. 1869年，怀俄明州向妇女提供选举权，希望吸引妇女到西部去。

In 1870 the territory of Utah granted voting rights to women upon the stipulation that plural marriage would become illegal. Federal lawmakers hoped that by extending suffrage that Mormon women could ensure the end of plural marriage. 1870年，犹他州授予妇女投票权，条件是复数婚姻将成为非法。联邦立法者希望，通过扩大选举权，摩门教徒妇女可以确保结束复数婚姻。\
In 1883 the women in Washington territory get <mark style="color:blue;">suffrage</mark>. 1883年，华盛顿地区的妇女获得了选举权。

Colorado state granted women’s voting rights after a hard-fought campaign by suffragists Carrie Chapman Catt. In 1900, Catt was elected the president of the National American Women Suffrage Association (NAWSA). 科罗拉多州在女权主义者凯莉-查普曼-凯特（Carrie Chapman Catt）的艰苦斗争下，授予妇女投票权。1900年，凯特当选为美国全国妇女选举权协会（NAWSA）主席。

### <mark style="color:blue;">Woman Suffrage and the Progressive Era</mark>

The California Campaign of 1911 for Woman Suffrage modernized the Suffrage Movement.

Yellow became the color to symbolize suffrage.

Women used tactics such as: standing on soap boxes on corners and singing in parks and parades to garner attention. Singing was particularly inventive because in some places it was illegal for women to publically speak about suffrage but speaking laws did not include singing.
